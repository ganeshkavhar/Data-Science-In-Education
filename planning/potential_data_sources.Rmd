# Potential data sources

## Types of data

### Large, Nationally-representative data sets

* [PISA data](https://github.com/jrosen48/pisaUSA15)
* [NAEP](https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/)

### Synthetic data sets?

* Via [synthpop](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/synthpop/index.html)

    * Josh may want to create a synthetic version of a survey-related dataset
    
* Via [simstudy](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/simstudy/index.html)

## Ideas for other data sources

* Anonymized data sets from our own work?

* CMU's [data shop](https://pslcdatashop.web.cmu.edu/index.jsp?datasets=public)

## Features of data to consider / include

* Nested / hierarchical structure
* Messiness (in some / all of the data sets, and to a degree?)
* Relational / social network data
* A variety of *types* of variables (i.e., continuous, categorical / factor, string)
* A variety of demographic variables and variables related to the racial and ethnic group of individuals
