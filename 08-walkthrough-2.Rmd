title: 'Education Dataset Analysis Pipeline: Gradebook Walkthrough'
output: html_document

## Introduction
Gradebooks are nearly ubiquitous throughout K-12 classrooms, whether they exist as standalone Excel files, Google Sheets, or in proprietary software. 

This walkthrough goes through a series of analyses using the data science framework (link), using the sample [Assessment Types - Points](http://web.mit.edu/jabbott/www/excelgradetracker.html) Excel gradebook template from MIT. All data in the sample gradebook have been generated, and do not reflect individual student data.

## Driving Question and Objectives

***

## Data Import
Setting up our environment (note: how deep do we go into working directories?!)
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

Importing our data (need to sim data for 25 students)
Check text for object naming conventions, discussion of .csv, .xlsx, versatility of import functions within the `tidyverse`
File naming - issues that can arise from spaces
```{r}
gradebook <- readxl::read_excel(here("/data/gradebooks", "ExcelGradeTrackerAssessmentTypePoints_SIMDATA_01.xlsx"))
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
