## Narative Structure 

Contributors should use this structure to help focus their work on the main point of a chapter or section of the book.

**Part 1: Chapters 1-4**

- Educators who use data science techniques face unique challenges  
- It takes a lot of people in different roles to create a good learning environment. Different education roles mean different datasets, techniques, and challenges

**Part 2: Chapters 5-9**

- Readers can learn and practice steps in the analysis process  
- The walk-throughs use education datasets that feel familiar to education workers. Readers can work through examples that feel more practical than commonly used datasets like mtcars or iris  
- Resources like R for Data Science, blog posts, and data science forums are part of the ongoing learning process

A note on the purpose of this section: This section can serve the same purpose as blog posts like this one. Readers can get practical instruction, then deepen their learning by reading more in-depth materials.

**Part 3: Chapters 10-12**

- Now that educators are familiar with some data science techniques, it's time to tackle applying and sharing those techniques at work. This is its own skill.  
- Connect the skills taught in Part 2 to the unique challenges discussed in Part 1 
- Explore how to use programming, statistics, and content knowledge in an education workplace that is new to data science  
- Explore how educators can teach today's students to prepare them for using data in future work places
