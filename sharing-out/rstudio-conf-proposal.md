# Planting the seeds: Expanding access to data science in education

# Abstract
This presentation reports on efforts to expand access to data science through the collaborative writing of a book about data science in education. Contributors to the book work together through the use of tools like git/GitHub and Bookdown to describe the challenge of doing data science in educationâ€”and its promise. We show how writing the book in the open empowers individuals from a myriad of roles in education to contribute and improve the product. Contributors draw from their experiences in K-12 and higher education contexts to bring definition to data science in the education setting. Last, the authors discuss how the growth of data science in education has implications for other professions that are beginning to explore data science.

# Biographies

## Ryan Estrellado

Ryan is a public school administrator whose mission is to explore and share ways to create new education knowledge through data science techniques. An everyday rstudio user, Ryan uses data analysis to consult and train school staff and administrators on a variety of topics.

## Jesse Motsipak

Jesse is a former molecular biologist turned public school teacher who eventually taught herself enough R and statistics to become a career data scientist. Starting with her first data science job, Jesse has built data science departments from the ground up at three organizations - often as the only data scientist on staff - and continues to develop and refine her skillset by helping educational nonprofits become more data driven.

## Joshua Rosenberg

Joshua is an Assistant Professor of STEM Education at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. In his research, he tries to understand how learners work with data as a context for learning, particularly in science content areas. A former high school science teacher, Joshua has also taught classes at the post-secondary level in the areas of science education, educational technology, and research methods.
