# How to Use This Book 

It is really hard to draw clean boundaries around the topic of data science in 
education because people are educated in all kinds of settings and in all kinds 
of age groups. Education organizations require different kinds of staff to 
make it work, which means different kinds of data science uses. A teacher's 
approach to learning from data is different from an administrator's or an 
opeartions manager. 

Since there are many different readers, we believe there should be 
different ways to use the book, both as a reader and as a contributor. Here are 
some ways to use this book:   

**Read the Book Cover to Cover**

Reading the book all the way through will give a nice high level view of data 
science in education, starting from the unique challenges of using data science 
in education and ending with code for example analyses. 

**Pick a Chapter That is Useful for Your Level of Experience and Start There** 

If you are a student or if you work in education, you may be trying to solve a 
very specific problem with data, like analyzing student quiz scores, projecting 
classroom sizes, or pitching a new data analysis method. In this case it might 
be useful to jump ahead to a chapter or section that discusses your area of 
interest. 

**Read Through the Walkthroughs and Run the Code**

If you are here to learn and practice coding in R, you can work through the 
example analyses. We wrote these based on typical data problems you might find 
as a student or staff in education, so it is worthwhile to copy or type the code, 
run it in your console, and change it to experiment with the results. 

**Contribute to the Book**

We quickly learned when planning the book that there are many ways to approach 
this topic and still we wanted to write in a way that is directly useful and 
practical for our readers in education. One way to meet this goal is to build 
procedures into the work for readers to directly contribute. We hope that as the 
book evolves it grows to reflect the observable needs of data scientists in 
education. Here are some ways readers can contribute: 

 - Submit a pull request to our 
 [GitHub site](https://github.com/jrosen48/data-science-in-education) that 
 describes a data science problem that is unique to the education setting 
 - Submit a pull request to share a solution for the problems discussed in the 
 book
 to the education setting
 - Share an anonymized dataset
